## Getting started

The simplest way to use the dashboard grid is pass it a set of cards and let it figure out its own layout to use.

```jsx
import { DashboardGrid, CARD_SIZES, CARD_TYPES, Card } from 'carbon-addons-iot-react';

<DashboardGrid>
  {[
    <Card
      title="Facility Metrics"
      key="facility"
      id="facility"
      size={CARD_SIZES.MEDIUM}
      type={CARD_TYPES.VALUE}
      availableActions={{
        delete: true,
      }}
      content="My Facility Metrics"
    />,
  ]}
</DashboardGrid>;
```

## Custom layout

Pass a custom layout to the dashboard grid to assign positions and sizes to the various cards.
In this case, only the lg and md breakpoint have a custom layout defined. Resize the screen to see
the cards reposition and resize themselves at different layouts. In this example, when the screen matches
the lg breakpoint size, the card with the id 'facility' will be in the fifth row and fifth column
(zero-based index), the card with the id 'humidity' will be in the first column and first row, and the
card with the id 'utilization' will be in the fourth column and first row. However, since the humidity
card already occupied that space, it will get pushed down to the next row by the auto-reflowing of the
grid so that no cards overlap.

```jsx
<DashboardGrid
  layouts={{
    lg: [
      { i: 'facility', x: 4, y: 4, w: 1, h: 1 },
      { i: 'humidity', x: 0, y: 0, w: 1, h: 1 },
      { i: 'utilization', x: 3, y: 0, w: 1, h: 1 },
    ],
    md: [
      { i: 'facility', x: 0, y: 0, w: 1, h: 1 },
      { i: 'humidity', x: 0, y: 1, w: 1, h: 1 },
      { i: 'utilization', x: 0, y: 2, w: 1, h: 1 },
    ],
  }}
>
  {[
    <Card
      title="Facility Metrics"
      key="facility"
      id="facility"
      size={CARD_SIZES.MEDIUM}
      type={CARD_TYPES.VALUE}
      availableActions={{
        delete: true,
      }}
      content="My Facility Metrics"
    />,
    <Card
      title="Humidity"
      key="humidity"
      id="humidity"
      size={CARD_SIZES.SMALL}
      type={CARD_TYPES.VALUE}
      availableActions={{
        delete: true,
      }}
      content="My Humidity Values"
    />,
    <Card
      title="Utilization"
      id="utilization"
      key="utilization"
      size={CARD_SIZES.SMALL}
      type={CARD_TYPES.VALUE}
      availableActions={{
        delete: true,
      }}
      content="My utilization chart"
    />,
  ]}
</DashboardGrid>
```

## Editable layout

You can drag and drop the cards around. The `onLayoutChange` handler will be triggered each time you
drop a card in a new location. The card array contains objects representing each card in the layout,
similar to the layout prop above. It's easiest to inspect the output in the Actions tab of the
[is editable story](/story/1-watson-iot-dashboard-grid--dashboard-is-editable) to see the
callback in action. This `onLayoutChange` can be used to save the current state of the grid so that
it can be re-created later.

```jsx
<DashboardGrid isEditable onLayoutChange={(cardArray, layoutObject) => {}}>
  {[
    <Card
      title="Facility Metrics"
      key="facility"
      id="facility"
      size={CARD_SIZES.MEDIUM}
      type={CARD_TYPES.VALUE}
      availableActions={{
        delete: true,
      }}
      content="My Facility Metrics"
    />,
    <Card
      title="Humidity"
      key="humidity"
      id="humidity"
      size={CARD_SIZES.SMALL}
      type={CARD_TYPES.VALUE}
      availableActions={{
        delete: true,
      }}
      content="My Humidity Values"
    />,
    <Card
      title="Utilization"
      id="utilization"
      key="utilization"
      size={CARD_SIZES.SMALL}
      type={CARD_TYPES.VALUE}
      availableActions={{
        delete: true,
      }}
      content="My utilization chart"
    />,
  ]}
</DashboardGrid>
```

## Resizable cards

By passing `isResizable` to the cards in a DashboardGrid, the cards become resizable by dragging and
the card size prop is automatically updated to match the new size during the drag process. This triggers
the `onCardSizeChange` callback which is passed two parameters. The first is an object giving details
about the card (its `id` and its `size`), and the second is an object containing information about
the DashboardGrid and its layout. Again, it's easiest to view the Actions panel in the [resizable card
story](/story/1-watson-iot-dashboard-grid--dashboard-resizable-card) to see callback in action.
The `onCardSizeChange` is triggered instantly as you drag and drop and the `onResizeStop` callback is
only triggered once you've stopped resizing the card. The `onResizeStop` or `onCardSizeChange` callbacks
can be used to save the layout state, so that it can be re-created later.

```jsx
<DashboardGrid
  isEditable
  onCardSizeChange={(cardSizeData, gridData) => {}}
  onResizeStop={(cardSizeData, gridData) => {}}
>
  {[
    <Card
      title="Facility Metrics"
      key="facility"
      id="facility"
      size={CARD_SIZES.MEDIUM}
      type={CARD_TYPES.VALUE}
      availableActions={{
        delete: true,
      }}
      content="My Facility Metrics"
      isResizable
    />,
    <Card
      title="Humidity"
      key="humidity"
      id="humidity"
      size={CARD_SIZES.SMALL}
      type={CARD_TYPES.VALUE}
      availableActions={{
        delete: true,
      }}
      content="My Humidity Values"
      isResizable
    />,
    <Card
      title="Utilization"
      id="utilization"
      key="utilization"
      size={CARD_SIZES.SMALL}
      type={CARD_TYPES.VALUE}
      availableActions={{
        delete: true,
      }}
      content="My utilization chart"
      isResizable
    />,
  ]}
</DashboardGrid>
```
