## Inline actions

Inline actions, also called row actions, can be made available for each row by using the
prop `options.hasRowActions`. The actions are defined by configuration objects added to each
row using the row data array prop `rowActions`. Each obj must contain a for the array unique `id`.
The row actions will appear in an extra column appended at the end of the table. A single row action
can be shown directly "inline" on hover but if there are multiple actions per row they should be placed in
an overflow menu by using the `isOverflow` property.

The action rendering supports both icons and labels. The special prop `isDelete` is used to format the option red and the
`isEdit` prop is used by the StatefulTable to automatically set the row action state in edit mode. See the table's
[Data prop](/docs/1-watson-iot-table--playground#data-prop) for the full list of row action props.

```jsx
...

const dataWithActions = data.map((row) => ({
  ...row,
  // All rows will get the same row actions
  rowActions: [
    // This is rendered as an inline action with an icon
    {
      id: 'drilldown',
      renderIcon: ArrowRight16,
      iconDescription: 'Drill in',
      labelText: 'Drill in to find out more after observing',
    },
    // These actions are rendered as a menu items with icons in an overflow menu
    // with a divider between them
    {
      id: 'edit',
      renderIcon: Edit16,
      labelText: 'Edit',
      isOverflow: true,
      iconDescription: 'Edit',
      isEdit: true,
      disabled: true,
    },
    {
      id: 'delete',
      renderIcon: TrashCan16,
      labelText: 'Delete',
      isOverflow: true,
      iconDescription: 'Delete',
      isDelete: true,
      hasDivider: true,
    },
  ],
}));

return (
  <MyTable
    columns={columns}
    data={data}
    options={{
      hasRowActions: true,
    }}
  />
);
```

### Handling the onApplyRowAction event

When a row action is clicked (or selected) the table will call `actions.table.onApplyRowAction` with the id of the
row action and the id of the row. A normal flow would be to identify the type of action and then update the state
of the row by adding a state object to the array prop `view.table.rowActions` before triggering the
actual action. When the action has finished the state of the row is updated again.

A row action state object must contain the id of the row and can specify either that the action is being processed
by using the boolean prop `isRunning`, that the row is now in edit mode using the boolean prop `isEditMode` or
that the action had failed by using the object prop `error`. See the table's
[View Prop](/docs/1-watson-iot-table--playground#view-prop) for the full list of props the objects in
`view.table.rowActions` can use.

The code example below shows how to implement a row action that starts a mocked long running process.

```jsx
...

const [rowActionStates, setRowActionStates] = useState([]);
const dataWithActions = data.map((row) => ({
  ...row,
  // Add the row actions to every row
  rowActions: [
    {
      id: 'longRunningProcess',
      labelText: 'Start the process',
    },
  ],
}));

// Display an error msg when the action fails
const handleRowActionError = (rowId, { name, message }) => {
  setRowActionStates((current) =>
    current.map((actionState) =>
      actionState.rowId === rowId
        ? {
            ...actionState,
            isRunning: false,
            error: {
              title: name,
              message,
            },
          }
        : actionState
    )
  );
};

// Remove the row action state when the process has successfully finished
const handleRowActionSuccess = (rowId) => {
  setRowActionStates((current) => current.filter((actionState) => actionState.rowId !== rowId));
};

const onApplyRowAction = (actionId, rowId) => {
  // In this scenario there is only one row action defined but in a real case
  // there might be multiple
  if (actionId === 'longRunningProcess') {
    setRowActionStates((current) => [...current, { rowId, isRunning: true }]);
    runMockedProcess
      .then(() => handleRowActionSuccess(rowId) )
      .catch((err => handleRowActionError(err));
  }
};

return (
    <Table
    columns={columns}
    data={dataWithActions}
    actions={{
      table: {
        onApplyRowAction,
      },
    }}
    options={{ hasRowActions: true }}
    view={{
      table: {
        rowActions: rowActionStates,
      },
    }}
 />
);
```
