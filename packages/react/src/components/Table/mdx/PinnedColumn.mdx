## Pinned column

One column in the table body and table head can be pinned, so that it will keep its position regardless of horizontal scrollbar. There are 3 options to pin column in a table - `none` default, `first` and `last`. The selected column will be freezed and border of `1px` will be displayed to the direction of a content. In case there are additional actions on a row, such as selection, nesting or both, then columns with action icon will be pinned as well. For example, if option `hasRowSelection: 'multi'` is configured with `pinColumn: 'first'` then column with checkboxes will be freezed along with first content column. The same applies to the table head, if table has `hasFilter: true` and `pinColumn: 'first'` then filtering input will be pinned with first column automatically.

```jsx

...

return (
  <Table
    columns={columns}
    data={data}
    options={{
      pinColumn: 'first',
      hasFilter: true,
      hasRowSelection: 'multi',
    }}
    view={{}}
  />
);
```
