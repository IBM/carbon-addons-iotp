## Searching

The Table provides a built in UI for search which is enabled by setting the prop `options.hasSearch` to true.
The search field is collapsed by default and is expanded through an icon button in the table toolbar or
programmatically by setting the prop `view.toolbar.search.defaultExpanded` or `view.toolbar.search.isExpanded`
to true. The defaultExpanded will initially expand the search field but also allows it to collapse when a search
is cleared, whereas the isExpanded will force it to always stay open.

When a user types into the search field the search is immediately triggered and the function supplied for
`actions.toolbar.onApplySearch` is called for each keystroke. If the prop `options.hasFastSearch` is set to
`false` then a search is only triggered by any of the following actions:

- the user hits 'Enter' in the search field
- the search field loses focus
- the button 'Clear search input' marked "x" is clicked

The search value can also be programmatically set using the prop `view.toolbar.search.defaultValue` which
will update the search field and trigger a new search.

The `StatefulTable` automatically filters on the data supplied by the `data` prop but for the normal `Table`
the `onApplySearch` event must be handled to update the table data programmatically. The StatefulTable will
only search on values of the type strings, numbers and booleans and there is no search equivalent to the
column props sortFunction and filterFunction. In order to search on complex types a programmatic search
implementation is needed.

### Simple search code example

The example below shows how to enable search for the StatefulTable with a default search value set on initial
rendering.

```jsx
...

return (
  <StatefulTable
    columns={columns}
    data={data}
    options={{
      // Enables the built in search
      hasSearch: true,
    }}
    view={{
      toolbar: {
        search: {
          // The table will be rendered with an active search for "helping"
          defaultValue: 'helping',
        },
      },
    }}
  />
);
```

### Programmatic search

To implement a custom search for the normal `Table` the event for `actions.toolbar.onApplySearch` must be
handled. The function receives the current search value as a parameter and can be used to directly modify
the `data` prop as shown in the example below or trigger an asynchronous search in the backend. There is no
automatic loading state triggered so if the search is not near instant it is wise to activate the loading
skeletons using the prop `view.table.loadingState.isLoading` while executing.

The normal Table also fires an onExpand event (`view.toolbar.search.onExpand`) when the search field is
expanded but there is normally no need to handle that since the search component always manages its own
expanded state.

The example below shows how to implement a custom search on the "id" string of values of type Object.

```jsx
...

const [filteredData, setFilteredData] = useState(data);

const handleObjectSearch = (newSearchValue) => {
  setFilteredData(
    data.filter((row) => {
      const cellValues = Object.values(row.values);
      return cellValues.find((value) => {
        const isObjectWithIdString = typeof value === 'object' && typeof value?.id === 'string';
        return isObjectWithIdString && value.id.toLowerCase().includes(newSearchValue.toLowerCase());
      });
    })
  );
};

return (
  <Table
    i18n={{ searchPlaceholder: 'Search on Object id' }}
    actions={{
      toolbar: {
        onApplySearch: handleObjectSearch,
      },
    }}
    columns={columns}
    data={filteredData}
    options={{
      hasSearch,
      hasFastSearch: false,
    }}
    view={{
      toolbar: {
        search: {
          defaultExpanded: true,
        },
      },
    }}
  />
)

```

Note! From a UX perspective it is not recommended to have both column filters and the built in search enabled at the
same time.
